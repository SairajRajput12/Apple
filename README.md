# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection API 🌿

<img src="https://media.tenor.com/67EGa-wMf5MAAAAM/sherlock-benedict-cumberbatch.gif" alt="Sherlock Holmes Observing" width="400"/>

This is a Flask-based API for detecting diseases in various crops using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models. The system takes a base64-encoded image of a plant leaf and the name of the crop as input, and returns the predicted class (disease) of the plant based on the image. Check out our API here: [Plant Disease Prediction API](https://plant-disease-prediction-echd.onrender.com)


This will display the GIF on the page when rendered in environments that support HTML, such as GitHub README files or other markdown editors with HTML support. You can adjust the width to suit your layout needs.
## 🌟 Features
- 🧑‍🌾 Supports detection for multiple crops, including apple, corn, cherry, grape, peach, pepper, potato, soybean, strawberry, and tomato.
- 📷 Takes input as base64-encoded image and crop name.
- ⚙️ Utilizes pre-trained TFLite models to predict the disease based on the image.
- 🏷️ Returns the predicted disease class for the given crop.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.10.11
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- Pillow
- NumPy
- tflite-runtime

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/plant-disease-detection-api.git
   cd plant-disease-detection-api
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pillow numpy flask-cors tflite-runtime
   ```

3. Ensure you have the TFLite models for each crop in the appropriate format. Place the models (`apple.tflite`, `corn.tflite`, etc.) in the root directory or modify the paths accordingly.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Send a POST request to `/predict` with the base64-encoded image and the crop name as JSON. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "img_base64": "your_base64_encoded_image_here",
     "name": "apple"
   }
   ```

3. Example response:
   ```json
   {
     "prediction": "Apple___Apple_scab"
   }
   ```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### `GET /`
- Returns a welcome message indicating that the API is running.

### `POST /predict`
- **Description:** Predicts the disease class of the provided image for the specified crop.
- **Request Body:**
  - `img_base64`: Base64 encoded image string.
  - `name`: Name of the crop. Supported values: `apple`, `corn`, `cherry`, `grape`, `peach`, `pepper`, `potato`, `soyabean`, `strawberry`, `tomato`.
- **Response:**
  - `prediction`: Predicted class of the plant disease.

## ⚠️ Error Handling
- If no image or crop name is provided, the API returns a 400 status code with an error message.
- If an invalid crop name is provided, the API returns a 400 status code with an error message.
- If any internal error occurs, the API returns a 500 status code with the error details.
